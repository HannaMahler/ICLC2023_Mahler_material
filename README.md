# ICLC2023_Mahler_material
This repository contains the code and data required to perfom the regression model presented by Hanna Mahler at the ICLC 2023 in Mannheim, Germany. 
The regression model predicts the number of verb phrases in a given text from the GECCo corpus of English and German.

# Files included:
- R Markdown "GECCO_Verbs_regression": This script reproduces the regression model that I report on in the presentation. The script includes prior selection, model fitting, model assessment and model comparison.
- R Markdown "GECCO_Verbs_visualisations": This script reproduces the diagrams shown in the presentation (as well as some additional visualisations).
- Excel spreadsheet "Overview_texts_vp": This spreadsheet contains the measurements on the level of the individual texts in the GECCo corpus.
- - Excel spreadsheet "Overview_registers_vp": This spreadsheet contains the measurements on the level of register. 
- Folder "Models" with rds-files: This folder contains the regression models that are produced in the "GECCo_Verbs_regression" script as rds-objects. If fitting the models takes too long they can be loaded directly from this folder.
- PDF "Presentation_Mahler_ICLC10_2023": these are the slides of my presentation.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Please do not distribute this data or these scripts any further without my consent.
